# Custom Readme Generator

## Description

In this weeks challenge for the coding bootcamp, the requirement was to create a custom readme file generator so that a user could easily create a readme by entering some inputs in the terminal.

## Usage

Upon running "node ./index.js" the user will be prompted to enter details about their project. The user entered text will appear under the relevant headings in the readme file.
